    - title: Foster a community of service to one another
      text: We all want to help each other, we often just don't know how. With WeCarry it becomes easy to discover ways to serve one other as well as request help in a less direct and more graceful way.

    - title: Simplify hand-carry logistics
      text: WeCarry makes it easy for individuals to connect, even without knowing each other previously, in order to coordinate hand-carry support. No more playing Sherlock to find people traveling!
      icon: simplify.png
    - title: Improve personnel quality of life
      text: When staff serve outside of their home countries, it can be difficult to find familiar items such as comfort foods and household goods or receive care packages from friends and family. In serving one another via hand-carry support we can help improve the quality of life of our colleagues.

    - title: Reduce shipping, increase reliability
      text: There are many places in the world that cannot shop on major online retailer websites or have packages delivered to them with confidence. In other areas items of value have a tendency of "getting lost" in transit. Using a trusted hand courier can reduce costs and increase confidence in items getting to their destinations.

    - title: Enjoy yummy treats like grandma's cookies
      text: We really hope WeCarry is not only used for productive business related carries but also for fun and tasty treats! Seriously, who doesn't want some of their grandma's cookies from time to time?

      quote: When I moved to PNG I thought a suitcase of grandma's fruit cake would last for years. I was wrong. We have people traveling here all the time but I never know who is coming to ask to bring some. I can't wait for WeCarry to satisfy my fruit cake cravings!

      quote: As the local IT coordinator, getting access to new computer equipment is difficult, either I can't have it shipped directly to me or it gets "lost" in transit. With WeCarry it'll be so much safer and more reliable to have colleagues bring what I need!

      quote: I spend a lot of time in meetings. I also love the local Bush Meat at lunch. Smell my problem? Thankfully with WeCarry I'll be able to get my favorite Altoids mints delivered on a regular basis, I can't wait, and actually neither can my co-workers ðŸ˜‰
